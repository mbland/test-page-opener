# Test Page Opener

Enables an application's tests to open its own page URLs both in the browser and
in [Node.js][] using [jsdom][]. Provides limited, though still very useful
support for opening pages that load external [JavaScript modules][] when using
jsdom.

## Installation

Add this package to your project's `devDependencies`, e.g., using [pnpm][]:

```sh
pnpm add -D test-page-opener
```

## Usage

```js
import { afterEach, beforeAll, describe, expect, test } from 'vitest'
import TestPageOpener from 'test-page-opener'

describe('TestPageOpener', () => {
  let opener

  beforeAll(async () => opener = await TestPageOpener.create('/basedir/'))
  afterEach(() => opener.closeAll())

  test('loads page with module successfully', async () => {
    const { document } = await opener.open('path/to/index.html')
    const appElem = document.querySelector('#app')

    expect(appElem.textContent).toContain('Hello, World!')
  })
})
```

### Reporting code coverage

`TestPageOpener` makes it possible to collect code coverage from opened browser
windows and to merge it with coverage from jsdom test runs.

For example, this project is configured to generate `coverage-jsdom/lcov.info`
and `coverage-browser/lcov.info`, the results of which are merged via the
[Coveralls GitHub Action][]. See:

- [ci/vitest.config.js](./ci/vitest.config.js)
- [ci/vitest.config.browser.js](./ci/vitest.config.browser.js)
- [.github/workflows/run-tests.yaml](./.github/workflows/run-tests.yaml)

See **Code coverage collection from opened pages, scripts, and modules** below
for further details.

## Features and limitations

### Limited JavaScript/ECMAScript/ES6 Module (a.k.a. ESM) support for jsdom

**jsdom** doesn't natively support [JavaScript modules][] at all, even though
Node.js has supported [ECMAScript modules][] since v18. The problem is that the
current Node.js ESM API leaves implementation of the nontrivial [ESM resolution
and loading algorithm][] up to the user. See: [jsdom/jsdom: &lt;script
type=module&gt; support #2475][jsdom-2475].

`TestPageOpener` provides limited support for loading external modules specified
by the `src` attribute of [&lt;script type="module"&gt; tags][esm-script-tag].
It achieves this by passing the `src` path to [dynamic import()][].

Inline module scripts and [&lt;script type="importmap"&gt;][] aren't supported.

#### Timing of `<script type="module">` execution

Technically, [imported modules should execute similarly to &lt;script defer&gt;
and execute before the DOMContentLoaded event][defer-imports].

However, `TestPageOpener` registers a `load` event handler that collects `src`
paths and waits for the dynamic `import()` of each path to resolve. It then
fires the `DOMContentLoaded` and `load` events again, enabling modules that
register listeners for those events to behave as expected.

#### Even more detail

`DOMContentLoaded` and `load` events from `JSDOM.fromFile()` always fire before
dynamic module imports finish resolving. In some cases, `DOMContentLoaded` fires
even before `JSDOM.fromFile()` resolves.

- If, immediately after `JSDOM.fromFile()` resolves, [document.readyState][] is
  `loading`, `DOMContentLoaded` has yet to fire. If it's `interactive`,
  `DOMContentLoaded` has already fired, and `load` is about to fire.

The [test/event-ordering-demo/main.js demo script][event-demo] from this package
shows this behavior in action. See that file's comments for details.

### Code coverage collection from opened pages, scripts, and modules

When `TestPageOpener` closes an opened page in the browser, it will collect
[Istanbul code coverage][] information from the page's [Window][] before closing
it. Otherwise any code coverage information generated by code running in the
other browser window would be lost. (The jsdom implementation doesn't need to do
this.)

#### Only supports Istanbul code coverage in the browser

[Vitest allows you to collect coverage][vitest-cov] via Istanbul, [v8 code
coverage][], or your own custom provider when running tests in Node.js. However,
`TestPageOpener` only supports Istanbul when running tests in the browser.

Technically, it's not strictly required that you use Istanbul for running tests
under Node.js and jsdom if you also run them in the browser. You may choose to
do so anyway for consistency's sake, in your continuous integration system if
nowhere else.

## Development

Uses [pnpm][] and [Vitest][] for building and testing.

Uses [GitHub Actions][] for continuous integration.

Developed using [Vim][], [Visual Studio Code][], and [IntelliJ IDEA][]
interchangeably, depending on my inclination from moment to moment.

## Motivation

### Validating initial page state using different DOM implementations

The `TestPageOpener` class enables smaller tests to validate the initial state
of an application's pages after the [DOMContentLoaded][] and [window.load][]
events. They can access the [DOM][] directly, using **jsdom** or any browser
implementation interchangeably. Running the same tests using Node.js, then in
different browsers, then becomes very easy using frontend development and
testing frameworks like [Vite][] together with [Vitest][].

### Accelerating development while building confidence

Using **jsdom** as a [test double][] in Node.js makes detecting and fixing
problems much faster than testing solely using the browser. Then running the
same tests unchanged in the browser increases confidence in both the code under
test and in the tests themselves.

Most of your code will behave the same way running under **jsdom** it will under
any browser implementation most of the time. This is why **jsdom** is such an
effective test double, because it helps validate most behaviors and catch most
programming errors very quickly. However, if the tests do reveal behavioral
discrepancies between **jsdom** and any browsers, developing robust, portable
solutions also becomes much faster than using larger tests.

`TestPageOpener` extends these benefits to page loading, which would otherwise
be beyond the reach of smaller tests. Not all of your smaller tests need or
should use it&mdash;most of your page logic should be testable independently
from its own [Window][] context. But you can use `TestPageOpener` to write
smaller, faster tests for some behavior that would normally involve writing
larger, slower tests.

### Testing independently from a backend server and tests in other languages

Using `TestPageOpener` with frameworks like [Vite][] and [Vitest][] can help
validate some page loading details without building and serving the backend.
This is especially convenient if the backend and/or your larger tests that use
[Selenium WebDriver][] or another browser-based framework are in another
language. You can iterate quickly on JavaScript, in JavaScript, without other
languages, tools, or processes involved until you're reasonably confident that
everything is in order.

### Reducing investment in writing and running larger test suites

`TestPageOpener` avoids having to validate _all_ page loading logic by _only_
using frameworks like [Selenium WebDriver][] that interact with pages by
launching a separate browser. It can validate loading behaviors that are beyond
the scope of unit tests for individual page components while using the same unit
testing framework.

Writing all page validation tests using `TestPageOpener` may not be feasible,
and isn't necessarily desirable. However, it enables rapid iteration on details
that can be validated this way. Combined with a suite of small, fast tests for
individual components, it can allow for fast smoke testing before running larger
test suites. In turn, this reduces the need to write as many larger tests, to
run them as frequently, or to spend as much time debugging failures.

### Improving coverage, efficiency, and productivity overall

Designing for testability, and using `TestPageOpener` to write smaller tests as
appropriate, can improve test coverage while relying less on larger tests to
validate everything. Failures can be caught (and fixes validated) by tests of
the appropriate size and scope, minimizing the time to diagnose, repair, and
recover from them. This improves the speed, stability, and coverage of the
entire test suite, making every individual test more valuable and more of a
boost to productivity. The larger and more complex the system&mdash;and the team
developing it&mdash;the greater the overall benefit.

and the Chain Reaction][].

## Background

I developed this while writing tests for the frontend component of
[mbland/tomcat-servlet-testing-example][], found under
`strcalc/src/main/frontend`. I started developing the Java backend first, then
wrote an initial [Selenium WebDriver][] test in Java against a placeholder
frontend page. When I started to focus on developing the frontend, I wanted to
see if I could write tests that could run both in Node.js and any browser.

`TestPageOpener` is the result of that experiment. At first I thought I might
use it to make _all_ of my frontend tests portable from jsdom to any browser.
Eventually I realized I only really needed it to validate page loading. The
[Vitest browser mode][] (using the [@vitest/browser][] plugin) enables all other
tests written using the [jsdom environment][] to run as expected in the browser.
